# Hector-Solana-NFT-Generator
Generate images and json files with the current Metaplex Metadata Standard

I used the hashlips art engine generator to makes this.

Here is how to use it:
1. Clone the repo in Visual studio code
3. Open the folder containing the repo (the Hector Solana NFTs Folder)
4. Open terminal --> yarn install
5. In terminal -->node index.js
